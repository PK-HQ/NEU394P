I'm PK, a 2nd year Neuroscience PhD student. I currently lead a project to understand the code that the visual area of the brain uses to enable vision. To achieve this, we record brain activity when the animal views images, and recreate the same neuronal firing with light in an attempt to manipulate their perception. 

<br/>I have a 7.5 year background in visual neuroscience, cutting-edge techniques to record and manipulate brain activity, and computational neuroscience (analyses). Hidden talents: combat sports and taking projects to publication.

Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on:
<br/>(1) Creating models that can predict/recover the code that the visual cortex uses for representing visual images
<br/>(2) Stock Market Prediction
<br/>(3) Generally neuroscience related topics, ideally realistic biologically-inspired models

I have not teamed up with anyone at this point, please feel free to reach out. Thanks!
