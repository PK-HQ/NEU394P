I'm PK, a 2nd year Neuroscience PhD student. I currently lead a project to understand the code that visual areas use to represent images. To achieve this, we record brain activity when an animal views images, and recreate the same neuronal activity with light in an attempt to manipulate their perception. 

I have a 7.5 year background across visual/consciousness neuroscience, cutting-edge techniques to record and manipulate brain activity, and computational neuroscience (analyses). Hidden talents: combat sports and taking projects to publication.

Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on:
<br/>(1) Creating models that can predict/recover the code that the visual cortex uses for representing visual images
<br/>(2) Modeling consciousness
<br/>(3) Generally neuroscience related topics, ideally realistic biologically-inspired models
<br/>(4) Stock Market Prediction

I have not teamed up with anyone at this point, please feel free to reach out. Thanks!
